# ðŸ“Œ PropEase Project Plan

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Project Name:** PropEase â€“ Real Estate Property Management System  
**Goal:** Build a web application that enables landlords to manage properties/tenants and allows tenants to handle payments, documents, and communications.  
**Approach:** Use AI to accelerate planning, development, and testing â€” ensuring faster iterations and better code quality.

## 2. ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Frontend:** Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary / AWS S3  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Frontend â†’ Vercel  
  - Backend â†’ Heroku / Render  
  - Database â†’ Supabase / Railway / AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)  

---

## 3. ðŸ“… Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

- Define detailed scope (landlord vs tenant features).  
- Design database schema with Prisma models (User, Property, Payment, Complaint, LeaseAgreement).  
- Map out REST API endpoints and authorization rules.  
- Document AI-assisted workflow (code generation, testing, PR review).  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)  
- API Specification (OpenAPI / Swagger)  
- AI Usage Guidelines  

---

### Phase 2: Backend Foundation

- Initialize Express.js backend with TypeScript support.  
- Setup PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM with migrations.  
- Implement JWT-based authentication & role-based access control (landlord vs tenant).  
- Define Prisma models:  
  - `User` (landlord, tenant)  
  - `Property`  
  - `Payment`  
  - `Complaint`  
  - `LeaseAgreement`  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- Secure auth service  
- User, Property, Payment, Complaint, Lease CRUD APIs  
- Prisma migration setup  

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Foundation

- Bootstrap React + Vite project.  
- Setup authentication flow (login/register with JWT).  
- Build landlord dashboard (manage properties, view tenants, track payments).  
- Build tenant dashboard (view rent, upload payment receipts, submit complaints).  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- Landlord dashboard prototype  
- Tenant dashboard prototype  
- API integration with backend  

---

### Phase 4: AI-Enhanced Development (Ongoing)

- Use AI tools (Gemini, GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit) to:  
  - Generate boilerplate React components, Express routes, and Prisma queries.  
  - Generate Jest + Supertest test cases (unit + integration).  
  - Review PRs and suggest improvements.  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- AI-assisted code scaffolding  
- Auto-generated test coverage reports  
- PR quality gate automation  

---

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

- Payment tracking (with status: Pending, Paid, Overdue).  
- Complaint system with status workflow (Open â†’ In Progress â†’ Closed).  
- Document uploads (Cloudinary / S3).  
- Notifications (email/SMS for payments, complaints).  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- Payment module  
- Complaint module  
- File upload system  
- Notification service  

---

### Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

- Deploy backend (Heroku / Render) and frontend (Vercel).  
- Provision managed PostgreSQL (Supabase / Railway / AWS RDS).  
- Add logging + monitoring (Winston, PM2, Datadog / Logtail).  
- Setup CI/CD (GitHub Actions for testing & deployment).  

âœ… **Deliverables:**  

- Live staging environment  
- Monitoring dashboard  
- Automated deployment pipeline

## 4. ðŸ“¡ AI Integration Strategy

1. **Scaffolding:** Use AI to generate React components, Express routes, Prisma models.  
2. **Logic Assistance:** Describe business rules (e.g., rent overdue calculation) â†’ AI drafts functions.  
3. **Testing:** AI generates Jest + Supertest unit & integration tests.  
4. **Consistency:** Feed Prisma models to AI for CRUD API + frontend integration.  
5. **Code Review:** CodeRabbit provides PR summaries & improvement suggestions.

## 5. ðŸ”‘ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|
| Over-reliance on AI | Always review and refactor AI-generated code before merging |
| Data inconsistency | Strict schema validation with Prisma + Zod |
| Authentication vulnerabilities | Enforce JWT expiration, refresh tokens, role-based access |
| Vendor lock-in (Cloudinary/S3/Heroku) | Abstract storage + deployment layer, keep migration docs |
| Scaling issues | Plan for PostgreSQL indexing, caching (Redis), and load balancer support |

---

## 6. ðŸš€ Success Criteria

- Functional landlord + tenant dashboards.  
- Secure authentication and role management.  
- Smooth handling of payments, complaints, and documents.  
- AI-assisted tests with >80% coverage.  
- CI/CD-enabled deployment.
